    {"How do you print \"Hello, world!\" to the console in Python?":"You can use the print() function, like this: print(\"Hello, world!\")."},
    {"What is the difference between single and double quotes in Python?": "There is no difference in functionality between single and double quotes in Python. Both can be used to represent string literals."},
    {"How do you define a variable in Python?": "You can define a variable by giving it a name and assigning it a value using the = operator, like this: my_variable = 42."},

    {"How do you access an element in a list in Python?": "You can access an element in a list by using its index, which starts at 0. For example, to access the first element in a list, you can use my_list[0]."},
    {"What is a function in Python?": "A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take parameters and return values."},

    {"How do you print \"Hello, world!\" to the console in JavaScript?": "You can use the console.log() method, like this: console.log(\"Hello, world!\");"},
    {"What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?": "let and const are block-scoped variables, while var is function-scoped. const is a constant, which means its value cannot be changed once it is assigned, while let and var can be reassigned."},
    {"How do you define a variable in JavaScript?": "You can define a variable using the let, const, or var keywords, followed by the variable name and its initial value, like this: let myVariable = 42;"},

    {"How do you define a function in JavaScript?": "You can define a function using the function keyword, followed by the function name and its parameters, like this: function myFunction(param1, param2) { // function body }"},
    {"How do you add an event listener to an HTML element in JavaScript?": "You can add an event listener using the addEventListener() method, like this: document.getElementById(\"myButton\").addEventListener(\"click\", myFunction);"},
    {"How do you use the ternary operator in JavaScript?": "The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if/else statement. It takes the form of condition ? expression1 : expression2, where condition is a Boolean expression, expression1 is the value to be returned if the condition is true, and expression2 is the value to be returned if the condition is false. For example: let result = age >= 18 ? \"You are an adult\" : \"You are a minor\";"}
